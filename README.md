Othello is a strategy game where 2 players compete to get maximum number of disks in the end both player have to place a disk on their respective turns whenever a player surrounds single or multiple disks of the opposite player with his/her disk all the disks of the opponent player will be converted to your disk. I have implemented this game using c++ and as a opposite player i trained the computer using Min Max algorithm. The AI will make sure you never win :)
